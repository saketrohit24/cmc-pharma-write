# Navigation Test Guide

## Testing the Files and Templates Navigation

### What Should Work:

1. **Header Navigation Tabs:**
   - Click "Editor" tab → Shows document editor with sidebar and right panel
   - Click "Files" tab → Shows full-page file manager 
   - Click "Templates" tab → Shows full-page template manager

2. **Quick Access Toolbar** (bottom-right, only visible in Editor view):
   - "Manage Files" button → Switches to Files view
   - "Templates" button → Switches to Templates view

3. **Generate Button** (in RightPanel):
   - "Generate from template" → Switches to Templates view

### Debug Steps:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12) to see debug logs
2. **Click Navigation Tabs** - should see console logs like:
   - "Switching to view: files"
   - "Current view: files"
3. **Verify Components Load** - each view should show different content:
   - Editor: Document editor with sidebar and right panel
   - Files: Full-page file manager with upload zone
   - Templates: Template manager with TOC editor

### Current State:
- ✅ App.tsx updated with proper routing
- ✅ Header component has navigation tabs
- ✅ All components properly imported
- ✅ Console logging added for debugging
- ✅ Quick access toolbar in editor view
- ✅ RightPanel "Generate from template" button connected

### If Navigation Still Not Working:

1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify the console logs appear when clicking tabs
3. Make sure the correct components are being rendered
4. Check that the state is updating properly

The application should now have fully working navigation between all three views!
