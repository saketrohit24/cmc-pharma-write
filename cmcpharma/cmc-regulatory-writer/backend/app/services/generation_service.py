SECTION_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """You are an expert technical writer. Your task is to write a comprehensive section for "{section_title}" based EXCLUSIVELY on the retrieved content from uploaded source documents.

Retrieved Content from Source Documents:
{retrieved_content}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY:
1. ONLY use information that is explicitly present in the retrieved content above
2. Write content that directly addresses "{section_title}" using the source material
3. NEVER add information not found in the source documents
4. DO NOT assume this is about pharmaceuticals, drugs, CMC, or manufacturing unless explicitly stated in the source
5. DO NOT use regulatory boilerplate language unless it appears in the source documents
6. FOCUS on the actual topics, organizations, and content mentioned in the source material
7. If the source discusses NIST, cybersecurity, instruments, etc., write about those topics
8. If the source discusses biology, write about biology
9. If the source discusses engineering, write about engineering

Content Formatting Guidelines:
- Start directly with the main content (DO NOT repeat the section title as a header)
- Use clear, logical structure with subsections
- Use ## for main subsections, ### for sub-subsections
- Include bullet points (-) and numbered lists where appropriate
- Generate 800-1000 words but ensure all content comes from the source material
- Include inline citations [1], [2], [3] when citing specific sources
- Use **bold** sparingly, only for key terms or important concepts
- Ensure proper paragraph breaks for readability

IMPORTANT - DO NOT ADD ANY "References" SECTION:
- DO NOT include any "References" section at the end
- DO NOT include any "Bibliography" section
- DO NOT list references like "[1] Author. Title. Journal."
- ONLY use inline citations [1], [2] within the text
- The reference list will be automatically generated by the system

Structure your response with clear subsections that flow logically to address "{section_title}".

If the retrieved content is insufficient for "{section_title}", state clearly what information is missing and what type of documentation would be needed based on the section title.

Write a comprehensive section about "{section_title}" using ONLY the provided source material:"""

## Information Gap Notice

No relevant information was found in the uploaded source documents for the section "{section_title}". This indicates that either:

1. The uploaded documents do not contain information relevant to this section topic
2. Additional source documents may be needed
3. The section title may need to be refined to better match available content

## What This Section Should Address

Based on the section title "{section_title}", this section would typically include:

### Key Information Areas
- Background and context relevant to {section_title.lower()}
- Technical details and specifications
- Methodologies and approaches
- Supporting data and evidence
- References to authoritative sources

### Required Documentation

To generate meaningful content for this section, please ensure that your uploaded documents contain:
- Information directly related to "{section_title}"
- Supporting technical documentation
- Relevant data, studies, or analyses
- Background materials and context

## Next Steps

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Review Uploaded Documents**: Verify that your source files contain information relevant to "{section_title}"
2. **Upload Additional Sources**: If needed, upload additional documents that address this section topic
3. **Refine Section Title**: Consider whether the section title accurately reflects the content you want to generate
4. **Check Document Format**: Ensure uploaded files are in supported formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and are text-searchable

Once relevant source material is available, this section can be regenerated with substantive, document-based content that directly addresses "{section_title}".

**Note**: This system generates content based on your uploaded documents. Without relevant source material, meaningful section content cannot be produced."""
