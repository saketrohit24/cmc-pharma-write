Analytical Method Validation Guidelines

Page 1:
Analytical method validation is a critical component of pharmaceutical development. According to ICH Q2(R1), analytical methods must demonstrate accuracy, precision, specificity, linearity, range, and robustness. The acceptance criteria for accuracy should be within ±5% of the nominal value for most analytical procedures.

For precision studies, the relative standard deviation (RSD) should not exceed 2.0% for assay methods and 5.0% for impurity determination methods. Linearity should be established using a minimum of five concentration levels with a correlation coefficient of at least 0.999.

The limit of detection (LOD) should be established as the lowest concentration that can be reliably detected but not necessarily quantified. The limit of quantification (LOQ) should demonstrate accuracy within ±20% and precision with RSD ≤20% at the quantification limit.

Robustness testing should evaluate the method's reliability when subjected to deliberate variations in method parameters such as pH, temperature, flow rate, and mobile phase composition. System suitability tests must be performed to ensure consistent method performance throughout the analysis.
