## Summary of Suggest Edit Bug Fix

**🐛 The Problem:**
The "Suggest Edit" feature sometimes replaced the entire section content instead of just the selected text. This happened when:
1. User selected text within a section
2. Applied a suggested edit 
3. The text replacement logic failed to find the exact selected text in the current section
4. System fell back to replacing the entire section with just the edited content

**🔧 The Fix:**
Implemented a robust multi-strategy text replacement system:

### 1. Enhanced Text Replacement (`findAndReplaceText` function):
- **Strategy 1**: Direct text replacement (original behavior)
- **Strategy 2**: Normalize whitespace and retry replacement
- **Strategy 3**: Fuzzy word-based matching for large selections (70% word match threshold)

### 2. Improved Error Handling:
- Instead of silently falling back to section replacement, the system now:
  - Shows an alert to the user explaining the issue
  - Asks them to reselect the text and try again
  - Prevents accidental section overwrites

### 3. Better Selection Detection:
- Enhanced selection capture with session storage backup
- More lenient validation for large paragraph selections
- Improved position mapping for whitespace normalization

**🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix:**
- ✅ Selected text editing works reliably
- ✅ Large paragraph selections are handled correctly  
- ✅ Whitespace and formatting differences don't break replacement
- ✅ Users get clear feedback when replacement fails
- ✅ No more accidental section overwrites

**🧪 Test Cases That Should Now Work:**
1. Select a sentence → Suggest edit → Only sentence changes
2. Select a paragraph → Suggest edit → Only paragraph changes  
3. Select text with extra whitespace → Still works
4. Select text after minor content changes → Graceful fallback with user notification

The fix ensures that the "Suggest Edit" feature respects user selections and provides predictable, safe editing behavior.
